**Project Description:**
The project entails two sections: Section A, focusing on Petroleum Data Analytics, and Section B, centered on analyzing a dataset regarding hypertension and ambulatory recording Venetia study.

**Section B:** 
**Petroleum Data Analytics**

In this section, we embarked on an analytical journey through the 'China_Oilfield.csv' dataset. Here's a breakdown of what we did:

**Data Exploration:** We started by examining the dataset's structure, including data types, missing values, and summary statistics. We also visualized the data using pair plots to understand variable relationships better.

**Correlation Analysis:** We calculated the correlation matrix and visualized it using a heatmap to explore relationships between variables and identify patterns.

**Linear Regression Modeling:**

Trained a linear regression model using all eight variables from 1983 to 1999 data to predict production from 2000 to 2006.
Repeated the model training using only four selected variables and compared the performance with the eight-variable model.
Utilized the trained models to predict production and compared their performance.
Outlier Detection and Removal: We detected and removed outliers to ensure the robustness of our models.

**Evaluation and Comparison:** Finally, we evaluated model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared, and compared different models to ascertain the most effective one.

**Section C:**
**Analyzing Hypertension and Ambulatory Recording Venetia Study Dataset**
In this section, we analyzed a dataset from the hypertension and ambulatory recording Venetia study. Here's what we did:

**Data Preprocessing:**
We loaded the dataset and made necessary adjustments, such as renaming columns for better understanding.

**Statistical Test:**
Conducted a Chi-squared test of independence to investigate the association between gender and sport activity.

**Evaluation and Interpretation:**
Interpreted the test results, including the test statistic, p-value, and determination of statistical significance.

**Assumption Checking:**
Verified if the statistical assumptions of the Chi-squared test were met.

**Conclusion:**
Through these analytical endeavors, we aimed to extract meaningful insights from the provided datasets, employing statistical techniques and machine learning models to gain deeper understanding and make informed decisions. These analyses not only provide valuable insights into the datasets but also demonstrate the application of various analytical techniques in real-world scenarios.
